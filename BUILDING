Installing
----------

To build and install ec2-boot-bench, run:
# make BINDIR=/path/to/target/directory install

This software should build and run on any IEEE Std 1003.1 (POSIX) compliant
system which
  1. Includes the Software Development Utilities option,
  2. Has OpenSSL available via -lcrypto -lssl and #include <openssl/foo>, and
  3. Provides /dev/urandom.

Platform-specific notes
-----------------------

- On macOS, the <unistd.h> header is broken and fails to declare necessary
  functions when _DPOSIX_C_SOURCE is defined.  To install on macOS, run:
# make CFLAGS="-O2 -D_DARWIN_C_SOURCE" BINDIR=/path/to/target/directory install

Updating build code and releasing
---------------------------------

The POSIX-compatible Makefiles are generated via `make Makefiles` from the
included (far more readable) BSD Makefiles.  To run this target, you will
need to have a BSD `make(1)` utility; NetBSD's `make(1)` is available for many
operating systems as `bmake`.

Release tarballs are generated via `make VERSION=x.y.z publish`, subject
to the same caveat of needing a BSD-compatible make.
